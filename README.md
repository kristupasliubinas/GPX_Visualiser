GPX Visualiser
--------------

A web application that visualises GPX file data in three different ways. This provides an interface to view and analyse GPX files. I developed it together with Sam Owen-Hughes and Sean Horgan for an Interactive Systems course at the University of Glasgow.

Three different data visualisations are:
- Route on the map
- Key data summary
- Graph display for Elevation and Heart Rate
